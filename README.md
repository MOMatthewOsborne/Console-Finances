# Console-Finances
# Challenges

The objective was to analyse an array and to get certain pieces of information from it. This was very challenging as there were a lot of new concepts involved. The main challenge for me was to work out how to manipulate multi dimensional arrays. I had a lot of difficulty trying to work out the best way to attempt things.

# What I learned

I learned about working with arrays. Adding to them, working with them. I also learned about javascript Math.round. In an earlier iteration I also used indexOf to try to solve a problem. This was also the most elaborate console log I had ever written. It is the most complicated JavaScript project I have been involvved with and it gave me a little bit of an idea of how to think with code.


Here is a screenshot of the application running in the console.
